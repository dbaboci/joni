<p><img src="https://joni.baboci.net/images/Joni%20Baboci%20Small%20Official.JPG" width="30%" style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;">I am a planner, architect and all-around urban enthusiast currently working as the General Director of Planning and Urban Development at the <a href=http://www.tirana.al>Municipality of Tirana</a>. My previous experiences include stints in the private sector and leading a groundbreaking planning and architecture start-up for the Albanian Government nicknamed <a href=http://planifikimi.gov.al/index.php?id=a1r&L=2>Atelier Albania</a>. I have meddled with planning and development at different scales working on the national plan of Albania, the regional plan for the coast of the country, the regional plan for the economic generator of the country, the Tirana-Durres region - as well as the <a href=https://tirana.al/artikull/plani-i-pergjithshem-vendor>Development Framework for the City of Tirana TR030</a>.</p>

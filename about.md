Hi there, I am Joni Baboci; a planner, architect and all-around urban enthusiast currently working as the Senior Advisor for Planning and Urban Development to the \[Municipality of Tirana](http://www.tirana.al). 

My previous experiences include stints in the private sector and leading a groundbreaking planning and architecture start-up for the Albanian Government nicknamed \[Atelier Albania](http://planifikimi.gov.al/index.php?id=a1r&L=2). I have consulted for various multilateral and cultural institutions including the World Bank and the Triennale of Milano. 

I have meddled with planning and development at different scales working on the national plan of Albania, the regional plan for the coast of the country, the regional plan for Tirana-Durres region - as well as the \[Development Framework for the City of Tirana TR030](https://tirana.al/artikull/plani-i-pergjithshem-vendor).

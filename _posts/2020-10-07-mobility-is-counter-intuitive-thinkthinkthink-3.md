As I mentioned in the [previous chapter](https://thinkthinkthink.substack.com/p/the-15-minute-city-thinkthinkthink) our need for understanding leads to simplification. Simplicity is lauded in aesthetics. It appeals to us. **We strive for clean lines, straight streets & ideal forms.** [James Scott describes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State) how the modern state - in an attempt to control at scale - standardizes and coarse grains. In the process, reality loses meaning: it becomes a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. It follows that approaches to resolving conflict in complex systems are counter-intuitive and achieve results non-linearly. **What seems easy and direct is neither.**

Mobility is probably one of the simplest city-wide systems. It is possible to measure all the variables to a certain degree of precision: infrastructure, vehicles, speed. The [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) is finite: all the possible different states of the system could be hypothetically computed in the near future. Despite it being a relatively comprehensible system our mobility policies abstract away to simple axioms. Most capital expenditure goes to monocentric car-subsidizing policies which have been repeatedly demonstrated to be counterproductive. **Complexity is counter-intuitive. It is inherently difficult to comprehend, let alone measure or control.**

The nineteenth-century economist William Stanley Jevons was the first to describe [rebound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)). **He remarked that increased energy efficiency does not lead to less total consumption.** Naively one might think that we spend less fuel the more fuel-efficient cars become. The opposite is true though: the more efficient a car is, the less it costs to drive it; this makes individuals drive more, ultimately increasing fuel consumption per capita. The graphs above illustrate how [worldwide per capita oil consumption has remained relatively steady](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita?time=earliest..latest&country=~OWID_WRL) while [fuel efficiency has almost doubled](http://www.umich.edu/~umtriswt/PDF/SWT-2017-5.pdf).

This is a similar phenomenon to induced demand. [Different](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261510000226?via%3Dihub) [researchers](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.6.2616) have established that increasing the capacity of infrastructure can have a null or negative long-term impact on traffic. This means that adding an extra lane to a congested system incentivizes more people to drive through it. Road expansion has negligent effects on improving traffic flow. **More infrastructure does not necessarily mean less traffic. On the contrary.** [Braess' proved](https://supernet.isenberg.umass.edu/articles/braess-encyc.pdf) that in a congested transportation network adding an extra road segment might impede traffic flow, and equivalently removing a segment might increase travel times. You heard that right - sometimes pedestrianizing an urban segment, can improve flow and reduce time spent in traffic for all drivers.

[Traffic is caused by a lack of coordination. Sudden congestion can appear on a highway without an obvious source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE) These phantom traffic jams are caused by a driver slowing down unexpectedly. The driver behind him will react to avoid a collision, which will often set off a wave of vehicles asynchronously slowing down. Keeping a sufficiently large buffer between vehicles helps shorten the length of phantom jams but - ultimately [lowering the speed limit during peak times can improve traffic efficiency and stability by creating a more homogeneous flow.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/news-and-events/news/2018/12/21/does-slower-driving-make-us-go-faster-.html) A lower speed limit reduces the individual margin of error of each driver‚Äôs stop-and-go, leading to overall improved system flow. **Driving slower can make you go faster.**
